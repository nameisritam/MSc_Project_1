**Introduction** <br>

<div dir="ltr">  
The project titled **Dynamic Analysis of Reserve Money Components and Sources: Evaluating RBI's Monetary Policy Impact through Time Series Modeling** aims to explore the intricate relationship between the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy and its influence on the components and sources of reserve money. Reserve money, a critical component of the monetary base, consists of currency in circulation and deposits held by commercial banks with the central bank. This project will employ advanced time series modeling techniques to analyze the dynamic interactions between reserve money, its sources (like RBI credit to government and net foreign assets), and key economic variables. By evaluating these interactions, the project seeks to provide insights into how changes in RBI’s monetary policy tools—such as open market operations, repo rates, and cash reserve ratios—affect the overall liquidity in the banking system and the broader economy. This analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of monetary interventions and their impact on inflation, interest rates, and financial stability in India.
