### Data Overview

<div align="justify">
  
  The dataset utilized in this study originates from the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) weekly financial statements, capturing a detailed breakdown of Reserve Money and its various components. Reserve Money, often referred to as high-powered money, serves as the foundation of the monetary supply in an economy, and understanding its components is vital for analyzing monetary policy impacts.

### Purpose

<div align="justify">
  
  This study aims to analyze the components and sources of Reserve Money in India, focusing on data provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Reserve Money, also known as high-powered money, is a crucial indicator in monetary economics, directly influencing the money supply and overall economic stability. By investigating the trends, patterns, and relationships within the components of Reserve Money, this study seeks to understand how monetary policy decisions by the RBI have shaped the financial landscape over time. The analysis is intended to provide insights into the effectiveness of the RBIâ€™s monetary policy tools and their impact on the broader economy.

### Methodology

<div align="justify">
  
  *i)* The study uses time series analysis to investigate the dynamics of Reserve Money components, including currency in circulation, bankers' deposits with RBI, and other deposits with RBI.<br>
  *ii)* ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling is employed to forecast future values of Reserve Money components.<br>
  *iii)* STL (Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series) is used to decompose the time series data to identify and analyze seasonal patterns within the Reserve Money components.<br>
  *iv)* VAR (Vector Autoregression) is applied to explore causal relationships between the RBI's claims on the government, banks, and the commercial sector.<br>
  *v)* PCA is used to identify the key factors driving changes in Reserve Money, helping to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most significant components.
